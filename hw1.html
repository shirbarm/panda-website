                    The giant panda lives in a few mountain ranges in central China, mainly in Sichuan, but also in
                    neighbouring Shaanxi and Gansu. As a result of farming, deforestation, and other development,
                    the giant panda has been driven out of the lowland areas where it once lived,
                    and it is a conservation-reliant vulnerable species. A 2007 report showed 239 pandas living
                    in captivity inside China and another 27 outside the country. As of December 2014, 49 giant
                    pandas lived in captivity outside China, living in 18 zoos in 13 different countries. Wild
                    population estimates vary; one estimate shows that there are about 1,590 individuals living in the
                    wild, while a 2006 study via DNA analysis estimated that this figure could be as high as 2,000 to
                    3,000. Some reports also show that the number of giant pandas in the wild is on the rise. In
                    March 2015, conservation news site Mongabay stated that the wild giant panda population had
                    increased by 268, or 16.8%, to 1,864. In 2016, the IUCN reclassified the species from "endangered"
                    to "vulnerable",[12] affirming decade-long efforts to save the panda.
                    While the dragon has often served as China's national symbol, internationally the giant panda has
                    often filled this role. As such, it is becoming widely used within China in international contexts,
                    for example, appearing since 1982 on gold panda bullion coins and as one of the five Fuwa mascots of
                    the Beijing Olympics.

                    Encouraged by the recent survey numbers and the increasing numbers of reserves and community 
                    development initiatives, WWF is confident, that with your help, we can ensure a future for 
                    pandas in the wild.

                    When you donate to WWF, you will be donating to panda conservation projects on the ground 
                    in China. Your donation will contribute towards a variety of initiatives, including:
                    Nature reserve protection to ensure that the reserve borders are patrolled and no illegal 
                    hunting or logging takes place inside them.
                    Community development projects such as providing wood saving stoves to limit the impact of 
                    wood-fuel harvesting on the panda's forests.
                    Research and monitoring work, such as setting up infrared cameras to record panda movements 
                    in the Minshan and Qinling Mountains.
